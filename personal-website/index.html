    <h4>Subject - Application for Front-end developer</h4>
    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Front-end developer position at Google. I
      recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I have gained practical experience in
      software testing, web development, and full-stack projects through my internships and training programs.</p>

      <p>In my role at VP Infotech, I performed comprehensive testing of applications, documented and tracked bugs using
      tools like DevOps and Jira, and collaborated closely with development teams to ensure high-quality software
      delivery. Additionally, through my college projects and training with Grow Tech, I developed front-end and
      back-end applications using React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, which strengthened my
      problem-solving and debugging skills.</p>

      <p>I am passionate about ensuring software quality and eager to contribute my skills to a dynamic team like yours. I
      am a quick learner, detail-oriented, and committed to delivering results. I am excited by the opportunity to grow
      professionally at Google and contribute to your innovative projects.</p>

      <p>I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm align with your team's goals. Thank you for
      considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Google.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
      <h4>Sincerely,</h4>
